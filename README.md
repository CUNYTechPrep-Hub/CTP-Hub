# CUNY Tech Prep Hub
CTP_Hub is the made for CTP students and staff by CTP students. The goal of CTP_Hub is to make Job tracking easier for the students and also provide a cleaner student management interface for the CTP staff. If you have exciting features that you want to share then send us a DM on Twitter: @ZeyaamShahid

## To-do
* Reconfigure the UI layout for both Student and Staff to be more User friendly and intuitive. We can start by changing from the "swimlane" search results to a drop-down menu and then changing the rest from there. One of the suggestions I got from the demo night were to look at other project/resource management software's UI layout for pointers and ideas.
  
* The User models need to be more detailed. For instance the StaffStudent model can have more attributes elaborating on the relationship between the two. The same is true of StudentJob model.
  
* The Signup and Login form need robust input validation, only email input validation has been implemented so far, password and name validation etc. are lacking.

* MAJOR refactoring has to be done, primarily on the front-end. I had to put together the Student and Staff Job Tracking interface in 7 hours for demo night so a lot of spaghetti code exists in those files as well as the signup form.

* Test data for the database needs to be modified since the models have been and will be updated.
